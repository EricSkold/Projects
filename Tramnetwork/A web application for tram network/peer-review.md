### Core assignment

_Does the application run?_
Yes

_Does the application display the complete map of tram lines?_
Yes

_Is it possible to query shortest path between any two points?_
Yes

### Optional tasks
_Is the submission successfully accounting for Bonus Part 1?_
Yes

_Is the submission successfully accounting for Bonus Part 2?_
Yes

### Code quality
The code from Lab 2 was used effectively - there is no unnecessary or repetitive code. The implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is done correctly and the function is defined just once. The way the cost function can be modified to use different costs in `dijkstra()` is as intended.

Section 1: Core assignment

•	Q1: Does the application run? --> yes

•	Q2: Does the application display the complete map of tram lines? --> yes

•	Q3: Is it possible to query shortest path between any two points? --> yes

Section 2: Optional tasks

•	B1: Is the submission successfully accounting for Bonus Part 1? --> yes

•	B2: Is the submission successfully accounting for Bonus Part 2? --> yes

Section 3: Code quality

The code from lab 2 has been used properly and correct. There is no prevalence of boilerplate code. Dijkstra is used as intended, where the definition of the function only occurs once. The distances are obtained by changing the cost function. 

Good job!
